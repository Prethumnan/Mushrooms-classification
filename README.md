# Mushrooms-classification

**Univariate Analysis**

cap-shape - Most of the mushrooms in our dataset have a convex  or a flat  cap

cap-surface - Most frequent cap surface is scaly  we have next to non grooves 

cap-color - Over half of the mushrooms in our dataset have a brown  or a gray  cap color, we also have 8 other colors that appear less often.

bruises - Most of the mushrooms in our dataset are not bruised 

odor - Most frequent scents  are either no smell  or a foul smell .

gill-attachment - Almost our entire data has free gill attachment so this column is pretty much useless in our analysis.

gill-spacing - More than 85% of the mushrooms in our dataset have a close gill spacing so it has little to no impact in our analysis.

gill-size - Most of the mushrooms in our dataset have a broad  gil sizes others are narrow.

gill-color - Over half of the mushrooms in our dataset have a buff ,pink  or a white gill color, we also have 9 other colors that appear less often.

stalk-shape - Most of the mushrooms in our dataset have a tapering  others are enlarging.

stalk-root - Most frequent stalk roots  are either bulbous  or silky.

stalk-surface-above-ring - Most frequent stalk surface above ring  are either smooth  or silky.

stalk-surface-below-ring - Most frequent stalk surface below ring  are either smooth  or silky  next to no difference from stalk-surface-above-ring.

stalk-color-above-ring - Over half of the mushrooms in our dataset have a white  stalk color, we also have 8 other colors that appear less often.

stalk-color-below-ring - Over half of the mushrooms in our dataset have a white  stalk color, we also have 8 other colors that appear less often, next to no difference from stalk-color-above-ring.

veil-type - All veil type of the mushroom's are partial so this column is pretty much usless in our analysis.

veil-color - Almost all of the mushroom's veil color are white  so this column is pretty much usless in our analysis.

ring-number - Almost all of the mushroom's ring number amount are one  so this column is pretty much usless in our analysis.

ring-type - Over 98% of the mushrooms in our dataset have a pendant ,evanescent  or a large  ring type.

spore-print-color - most frequent colors are white ,brown  ,black  and chocolate , the other colors are insignificant.

population - Most frequent populations  are either several  or solitary .

habitat - Most frequent habitats  are either woods  or grasses.

**Multivariate Analisys:**

cap-shape - Most of the knobbed mushrooms in our dataset are poisonous.

cap-surface - Most fibrous cap surface are edible.

cap-color - Most white cap colored mushrooms are edible while most yellow cap colored mushrooms are poisonous.

bruises - Bruised mushrooms are usually edible while unbruised ones are usually the oppisite.

odor - No smell mushrooms are mostly edible by a wide margin while all foul smell mushrooms are poisonous.

gill-attachment - The attached gills are almost always edible.

gill-spacing - The crowded gills are almost always edible.

gill-size - The narrow gill sized mushrooms are almost always poisonous.

gill-color - The buff gill colored mushrooms are always poisonous.

stalk-shape - insignificant difference betwwen each value in terms of poisonous or edible.

stalk-root - Mushrooms with missing data of stalk roots are usually poisonous.

stalk-surface-above-ring - The silky mushrooms are usually poisonous, smooth are usually edible.

stalk-surface-below-ring - About the same as stalk-surface-above-ring.

stalk-color-above-ring - The white stalk colored mushrooms are usually edible, pink ones are mostly poisonous.

stalk-color-below-ring - About the same as stalk-color-above-ring.

veil-type - All veil type of the mushroom's are partial so this column is pretty much usless in our analysis.

veil-color - Almost all of the mushroom's veil color are white (97.54%) so this column is pretty much usless in our analysis.

ring-number - Almost all of the mushroom's ring number amount are one (92.17%) so this column is pretty much usless in our analysis.

ring-type - The pendant ring typed mushrooms are mostly edible,evanescent are mostly poisonous and large ring types are all poisonous.

spore-print-color - The brown and black ones are almost entirely edible while white and chocolate (20.09%) are mostly poisonous.

population - Mushrooms with a several population are mostly poisonous.

habitat - The woods or grasses grown mushrooms are mostly edible.

From the ML Models that we created,Decision tree has done very well.
